      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        I am a full stack developer with a B.S. in Zoology. Formerly a zookeeper
        and embryologist, I have a love of learning and the natural world. I am
        interested in supporting behavioral, bio-tech/pharma, environmental and
        other researchers through database development and management as well as
        designing UI/UX components to enhance their data presentation.
      </p>
      <h3>Interests</h3>
      <p>
        I love rain, the Great Lakes, hockey and books. My guilty pleasure is
        playing Animal Crossing and Mario Kart with my 3 children and my
        husband. I am a pittie mom and a cat person. I love to cook and drink
        coffee, if I make you a pie we must be fast friends.
